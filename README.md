# Nexus

> **AI-Powered Financial Automation for E-commerce Businesses**  
> Nexus helps direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands automate bookkeeping, manage cash flow, and export tax-ready data — without the complexity of traditional accounting software.

---

## 🚀 Vision

E-commerce businesses face unique financial challenges: payment processor fees, marketplace reconciliation, COGS tracking, and complex revenue streams. Traditional accounting software isn't built for modern DTC brands. Nexus solves this by delivering:

- **Automated bookkeeping**: Transactions ingested from bank/POS feeds and categorized automatically using AI.
- **E-commerce intelligence**: Revenue, COGS, and operating expense tracking designed for Shopify-first DTC brands.
- **Cash flow visibility**: Predictive dashboards with real-time insights into unit economics and margins.
- **Tax-ready exports**: One-click QuickBooks/Xero push or CSV reports.

### 🧠 **AI-Powered Categorization**

- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite** for intelligent transaction categorization
- **67% cost savings** compared to traditional AI solutions
- **95%+ accuracy** with e-commerce-specific category intelligence
- **Rule learning** system that improves over time
- **38 e-commerce categories** covering revenue, COGS, and operating expenses
- **84+ automated rules** for common e-commerce transactions

💡 **Wedge:** Start with Shopify-first DTC brands (fragmented market, complex financials, underserved by traditional tools).  
🌍 **Long-term:** Expand across multi-channel e-commerce → become the "Financial OS" for online retailers.

---

## 📦 MVP Scope (8–10 weeks)

**A DTC brand owner can:**

1. Connect bank accounts and Shopify via Plaid/Square.
2. View a simple cashflow + P&L dashboard with revenue, COGS, and margin analysis.
3. Correct low-confidence categorizations with AI learning.
4. Export tax-ready data (CSV or QuickBooks/Xero).

**E-commerce-specific features:**

- Payment processor fee tracking (Stripe, PayPal, Shop Pay, BNPL)
- Shipping income vs. shipping expense separation
- Refunds and discounts as contra-revenue
- Inventory purchase and COGS tracking
- Advertising spend by channel (Meta, Google, TikTok)
- 3PL and fulfillment cost categorization
- Shopify payout reconciliation

**Out of scope for MVP:** Multi-marketplace (Amazon, eBay, Etsy), invoicing, payroll, inventory management, accrual accounting.
